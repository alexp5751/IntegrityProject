		The Integrity Project currently has franchise opportunities available in the United States. Current franchise areas are shaded in the map above for the state of Georgia.<br>
		<br>
		If you have a heart for people and you believe in their ability to grow and improve themselves and their lives, you might be a candidate for a franchise. <br>
		<br>
		The initial franchise fee is as low as $5000.00. Franchise investments typically begin at about $10,000.00 and go up from there. Some of the factors that affect franchise investments are: rent, target-area population, marketing, equipment purchases, office supplies, and training expenses. <br>
		<br>
		In addition to the initial franchise fee, the franchisee must pay royalty fees to The Integrity Project(R) and meet certain other requirements. <br>
