		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the classroom to the boardroom, and even to the courtroom, The Integrity Project速 has been making a positive difference since 2002. Some students have refined an already strong lifestyle of Integrity, while others have made radical life changes. (Like Dan St. John featured in the introduction video below.)  <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Character Development program like no other. The Integrity Project速 helps students develop personal Integrity from the inside out. It is a values development program working on the premise that if the values are good the behavior will be, too. This makes our program better than simple behavior modification programs. <br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classroom edition of The Integrity Project速 uses certified instructors who have been trained by the curriculum author, Terry Cliett. All instructors must demonstrate a high level of personal Integrity, and have a real compassion for people. The instructors use PowerPoint presentations and student books, as well as one-on-one conferences to guide students. <br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student population of The Integrity Project速 is diverse. Some students are community leaders. Some are business professionals who may want to use the programs and resources in their businesses. Others are college students who want to have an advantage over their classmates in the job market. Still others may be sentenced to us through the judicial system.<br>
